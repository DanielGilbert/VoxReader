# VoxReader

A C# library to read .vox files created with MagicaVoxel

---

## Currently supported features

At the moment it is possible to read:
- the size of the model
- all individual voxels including their color and position
- the palette that was used for the model

## Extending the library

Only .vox files that contain a single model are supported for now.

The file format specification made by [ephtracy](https://github.com/ephtracy) is available at [.vox file format](https://github.com/ephtracy/voxel-model/blob/master/MagicaVoxel-file-format-vox.txt)
